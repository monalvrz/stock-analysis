# Green Stocks Analysis

## Project Overview

Steve's parents are passionate about green eneregies. They believe that as fossil fuels get used up there will be more reliance on alternative energy production. There are many forms of green energy to invest in, including hydro elctricity, wind energy, geothermal energy and bio energy. However, Steve's parents haven't done much research and have decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. Steve is concerned about diversifying their funds. He wants to analize a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DQO stock by creating an Excel file containing the information to be analyzed. 

Therefore, this project focuses on the analysis of the green stock data base to offer Steve's parent a complete overview of the which company is the best option to invest in.
